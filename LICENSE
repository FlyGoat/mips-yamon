obligations under this Agreement to any third party without MIPS' prior

Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties
and their respective permitted successors and assigns. 6. LIMITATIONS

entitle Licensee to hard-copy documentation or to support, training or
maintenance of any kind from MIPS, including documentary, technical, or
telephone assistance. 7. TERM AND TERMINATION (a) This Agreement
shall commence on the Effective Date. If Licensee fails to perform or
violates any obligation under this Agreement, then upon thirty (30) days
written notice to Licensee specifying such default (the "Default Notice"),
MIPS may terminate this Agreement without liability, unless the breach
specified in the Default Notice has been cured within the thirty (30) day
period. This 30-day period may be extended upon mutual, written consent
between the parties. (b) Upon the termination of this Agreement due to
Licensee's material breach hereof, Licensee shall (1) immediately
discontinue use of the MIPS Deliverables, (2) promptly return all MIPS
Deliverables to MIPS, (3) destroy all copies of MIPS Deliverables made by
Licensee, and (4) destroy all copies of derivative works of MIPS
Deliverables made by Licensee while in breach of this Agreement. All
licenses granted hereunder shall terminate as of the effective date of
termination. (c) The rights and obligations under this Agreement which by
their nature should survive termination, including but not limited to
Sections 3 - 16, will remain in effect after expiration or termination hereof.
Subject to Licensee's compliance with the surviving sections of this
Agreement identified herein, any sublicenses rightfully granted and
derivative works rightfully developed pursuant to Section 2 shall survive
the termination of this Agreement. 8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES THE

FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF
THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDY (a)
Licensee acknowledges the MIPS Deliverables are provided to Licensee
only for the purpose set forth in Section 2. Licensee shall hold harmless
and indemnify MIPS from any and all actual or threatened liabilities, claims

DAMAGES, WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARISE UNDER A TORT,
CONTRACT OR OTHER CLAIM, OR DAMAGES TO SYSTEMS, DATA OR
SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION ON LIABILITY
SHALL SURVIVE EVEN IF THE LIMITED REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN
FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. IN NO CASE WILL MIPS' LIABILITY
FOR DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS
RECEIVED BY MIPS AS FEES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. 10. WAIVER;
MODIFICATION Any waiver of any right or default hereunder will be
effective only in the instance given and will not operate as or imply a
waiver of any other or similar right or default on any subsequent occasion.

be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom such
waiver or modification is sought to be enforced. 11. HAZARDOUS

nuclear, aviation, mass transit, medical, or other inherently dangerous
application. MIPS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR SUCH USE. LICENSEE REPRESENTS AND
WARRANTS THAT IT WILL NOT USE THE MIPS DELIVERABLES FOR
SUCH PURPOSES. 12. SEVERABILITY In the event any provision of this
Agreement (or portion thereof) is determined to be invalid, illegal or
otherwise unenforceable, then such provision will, to the extent permitted,
not be voided but will instead be construed to give effect to its intent to
the maximum extent permissible under applicable law and the remainder of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect according to its terms. IN
THE EVENT THAT ANY REMEDY HEREUNDER IS DETERMINED TO
HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, ALL LIMITATIONS OF
LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES SHALL REMAIN IN
EFFECT. 13. RIGHTS IN DATA Licensee acknowledges that all software
